[![macOS Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spring-projects/atom-concourse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spring-projects/atom-concourse) [![Windows Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/1jvknxt9jhykgrxo?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/spring-projects/atom-concourse/branch/master) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/spring-projects/atom-concourse.svg)](https://david-dm.org/spring-projects/atom-concourse)

This extension provides basic validation, content assist and hover infos
for editing Concourse [Pipeline](https://concourse.ci/pipelines.html) and [Task Configuration](https://concourse.ci/running-tasks.html) Files.

It is recommended to use this extension package when `atom-ide-ui` atom extension package is installed. Thus, reconciling (error/warning markers) and hover support is fully functional. 

## Usage

The Concourse editor automatically activates when the name of the file you are editing is `pipeline.yml` or `task.yml`, or editor grammar is set to `Concourse-CI-YAML` or `Concourse-Task-YAML`.

## Functionality

### Validation

(Requires `atom-ide-ui` package) As you type the manifest is parsed and checked for basic syntactic and structural correctness. Hover over
an error marker to see an explanation.

### Content Assist

Having trouble remembering all the names of the attributes, and their spelling? Or can't remember
which resource properties to set in the `get` task params versus its `source` attributes? Or
don't remember what 'special' values are acceptable for a certain property? Content assist
to the rescue:

read its detailed documentation.

### Navigate to Symbol in File

Resource Type declaration? The Atom Outline View (View -> Toggle Outline View) helps you quickly jump to a specific definition.
